This ensures that each Detection instance is specifically tied to these event types, and clearly attributed to a particular processing component within the system."}
{"class": "Measurement", "description": "Measurement is defined as a subclass of Observation. Every Measurement instance formally describes only entities classified as event:Measurement, ensuring it cannot describe other types of events. Additionally, each Measurement must be provided by either an event:Person or a Sensor, restricting its provenance to these two sources. This specification captures the nature of measurements as observational entities exclusively linked to specific events and originating strictly from people or sensor devices."}
{"class": "Recognition", "description": "Recognition is defined as a subclass of Observation. It is characterized by two key property restrictions: it can only describe instances of ComplexActivity events, and recognitions must be provided exclusively by either a Person or a ProcessingComponent. This ensures that all individuals of the Recognition class represent observations describing complex activities, with clear provenance limited to human or automated sources."}
{"class": "FixedSensor", "description": "FixedSensor is defined as a subclass of Sensor. This indicates that every FixedSensor is a type of Sensor, inheriting all characteristics of the Sensor class. No additional constraints or distinguishing axioms are specified beyond this hierarchical relationship, meaning FixedSensors share the essential properties of Sensors."}
{"class": "WearableSensor", "description": "WearableSensor is defined as a subclass of Sensor. This means that every instance of WearableSensor is also considered an instance of Sensor, inheriting its general properties and behaviors. WearableSensor typically refers to a sensor designed to be worn on the human body for the purpose of monitoring physiological signals, activity, or environmental parameters."}
{"class": "Observation", "description": "Observation is a class characterized by its formal linkage to a single event, as indicated by the restriction that each Observation describes exactly one event:Event. Each Observation is provided by exactly one provider, restricted to being either a event:Person, a ProcessingComponent, or a Sensor. Observations are further annotated with precisely one plausibility metric (hasPlausibilityMetric exactly 1 xsd:double) and exactly one reporting time (hasReportingTime exactly 1 time:Instant). These formal restrictions ensure that an Observation instance unambiguously refers to a specific event, has a single well-defined provider, includes a quantitative plausibility assessment, and records the precise time at which the observation was reported."}
{"class": "Report", "description": "Report is a class defined by a set of strict property restrictions: each instance must be provided by exactly one event:Person and must refer to exactly one instance of either home:Questionnaire, lab:ClinicalRecord, or lab:DemographicCharacteristicsRecord. Additionally, every Report must have exactly one hasPlausibilityMetric value of type xsd:double and exactly one hasReportingTime value of type time:Instant, with no other values permitted for these properties. The class definition ensures that each Report is uniquely associated with one provider, one time of reporting, a plausibility metric, and one described source record, reflecting a precise and singular reporting activity."}
{"class": "Result", "description": "Result is defined as a class whose instances must be described by exactly one home:DaySummary or home:Problem, and may only describe such entities. Each Result must be provided by exactly one agent, which must be either an event:Person or a ProcessingComponent, and cannot be provided by any other type. Every Result must have a reporting time, which must be exactly one instance of time:Instant, and no other type is allowed. Additionally, each Result must have exactly one plausibility metric, which must be of datatype xsd:double. This formalization ensures that every Result precisely links to its provenance, timing, evaluation, and what it represents within the domain."}
{"class": "Sensor", "description": "Sensor is a class characterized by the restriction that every instance must be attached to exactly one entity from the event:Entity class; no sensor can be attached to more than one, nor to any entity outside of event:Entity. This ensures a one-to-one association between each sensor and an event entity."}
{"class": "hasPlausibilityMetric", "description": "The property \"hasPlausibilityMetric\" has no explicitly defined characteristics, domain, or range constraints. It is not specified as a sub-property of any other property and has no defined inverse.

In the absence of further axioms or existing description, its use and related entities remain unspecified."}
{"class": "hasParticipant", "description": "The property \"hasParticipant\" has no explicitly defined domain, range, characteristics, super-properties, or inverse properties.
