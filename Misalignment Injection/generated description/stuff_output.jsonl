{"class": "AbstractRegion", "description": "AbstractRegion is defined as a subclass of Region. This indicates that every instance of AbstractRegion is also an instance of Region, inheriting all its characteristics. The class formalizes a conceptual or non-physical specialization of Region, but no additional constraints or distinctions are provided beyond its subsumption in the hierarchy."}
{"class": "PhysicalRegion", "description": "PhysicalRegion is defined as a subclass of Region, indicating that every PhysicalRegion is, by definition, a type of Region. This formalization distinguishes PhysicalRegion as a specific conceptual or spatial area within the broader class of Region, with characteristics or properties that pertain to physical or tangible attributes."}
{"class": "om-1:Quantity", "description": "om-1:Quantity is defined as a subclass of Region. This means every om-1:Quantity is categorized within the broader class of Region, inheriting its general characteristics. No additional restrictions or differentiations are provided, so om-1:Quantity serves to represent a more specific concept or type of Region within the ontology."}
{"class": "AmountOfStuff", "description": "AmountOfStuff is defined as a subclass of PhysicalEndurant, representing entities that persist through time while maintaining their identity as physical particulars. According to the current description, it aligns with DOLCE's notion of \"amount of matter\" and applies exclusively to specific, individual entities (particulars) rather than universals or collections. This class captures the concept of a definite quantity of physical substance."}
{"class": "Container", "description": "Container is defined as a subclass of PhysicalEndurant. It is characterized by the restriction that it may only be the inverse of containedIn with respect to AmountOfStuff or PhysicalObject; that is, only an AmountOfStuff or a PhysicalObject can be contained in a Container. The class is intended for use when an amount of matter is not self-contained, emphasizing the role of the Container in physically enclosing or holding such entities."}
{"class": "PhysicalObject", "description": "PhysicalObject is defined as a subclass of PhysicalEndurant, indicating that it inherits all characteristics of entities that persist through time while maintaining their identity. It is explicitly disjoint with Stuff, which means no individual can simultaneously be both a PhysicalObject and Stuff. This class represents discrete, countable entities as opposed to unstructured or undifferentiated substances."}
{"class": "Stuff", "description": "Stuff is defined as a subclass of PhysicalEndurant and is synonymous with \"Amount of Matter.\" Members of this class are restricted to having only states that are instances of StuffState, with a maximum of three such states per individual. This formalization captures the notion of matter existing in a limited number of distinct possible states."}
{"class": "AssociationalColloid", "description": "AssociationalColloid is defined as a subclass of Colloid. This class includes colloidal systems characterized by the association of amphiphilic molecules, such as hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions. Typical examples are micellar colloids (e.g., soap solutions), where molecules form aggregates known as micelles. Properties specific to this class can include aggregation numbers—typically a range—reflecting the number of molecules per micelle, often determined by the critical micelle concentration."}
{"class": "DispersionColloid", "description": "DispersionColloid is defined as a subclass of Colloid and represents the most common type among colloids, distinguishing it from other types within the Colloid category."}
{"class": "MolecularColloid", "description": "MolecularColloid is defined as a subclass of Colloid, representing colloidal systems in which the constituent molecules are sufficiently large to exhibit the characteristic behaviors of particles with intermediate sizes, typical of other types of colloids. Examples include latex and other materials with large polymers, such as starchy substances. This classification emphasizes the particle size and molecular structure as distinguishing factors within the broader colloid category."}
{"class": "Atom", "description": "Atom is defined as a subclass of PhysicalObject, indicating that every atom is considered a physical entity within the ontology. This classification places atoms within the broader category of tangible objects, establishing their role as fundamental physical units that compose matter."}
{"class": "Ion", "description": "Ion is defined as a subclass of PhysicalObject, meaning it represents a kind of physical entity. No further property restrictions, disjointness, or specific characteristics are asserted in the axioms, so the class encompasses any physical object identified as an ion—typically, an atom or molecule with a net electric charge due to the loss or gain of electrons."}
{"class": "Molecule", "description": "Molecule is defined as a subclass of PhysicalObject, with the restriction that every instance must have at least one part that is an Atom. In this ontology, molecule is modeled as a class representing types of chemically bonded structures rather than specific individual molecules. Molecules are characterized by being composed of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds, although the axiom specifies only the presence of at least one atom as a part to maintain simplicity and logical properties such as transitivity. This modeling choice supports reasoning about molecular types while staying within the constraints of first-order logic."}
{"class": "MultiMoleculeParticle", "description": "MultiMoleculeParticle is defined as a subclass of PhysicalObject, referring to a particle composed of multiple molecules, such as those found in suspensions or colloidal droplets (distinct from sub-atomic particles). This class is intended for cases where individual entities are aggregates of molecules, and, as noted in its annotation, is considered a pragmatic solution within the ontology structure rather than a rigorous chemical classification."}
{"class": "Bulk", "description": "Bulk is a subclass of Stuff, further constrained to entities whose granule type is either Molecule or MultiMoleculeParticle, or which consist only of or contain as parts other Stuff. Bulk is equivalent to either MixedStuff or StructuredPureStuff, and cannot be UnstructuredPureStuff. In practical contexts, particularly in the food industry, Bulk refers to goods such as soy beans, coffee, nuts, pet food, tea, whole grains, and sugar—items typically handled and measured in aggregate amounts rather than as individual units. The class accommodates various granularities (e.g., bags of nuts or packets of cookies are counted in units of the contained item type) and encompasses different material compositions, such as StructuredPureStuff (like sugar), HomogenousMixedStuff (such as stabilized peanut butter), and HeterogenousMixedStuff (e.g., pet food), highlighting the concept’s versatility in bulk goods handling and classification."}
{"class": "MixedStuff", "description": "MixedStuff is defined as a subclass of Stuff, with the additional restriction that any instance must have at least two component parts, each of which is itself an instance of Stuff (expressed as having at least two 'hasPartStuff' relations to Stuff). MixedStuff is explicitly disjoint with PureStuff, ensuring no overlap between mixtures and pure substances.\n\nConceptually, MixedStuff captures the essence of mixtures as materials composed of variable proportions of distinct, observable components that can be physically separated. The classification is based on the nature and roles of the components, explicitly excluding cases such as different phases of the same substance (e.g., ice in water), which remain PureStuff. Colloids are considered MixedStuff only when composed of different kinds of Stuff, maintaining the requirement for distinct observable constituents."}
{"class": "PureStuff", "description": "PureStuff is defined as a subclass of Stuff and is equivalent to entities that have exactly one granule type (either an Atom, Molecule, or MultiMoleculeParticle), exactly one part stuff (which must be either PureBulk, StructuredPureStuff, or UnstructuredPureStuff), and exactly one stuff distribution (which must be an EvenDistribution). In the literature, PureStuff has also been referred to as 'Unstructured stuff' and 'discrete stuff', and is characterized by being composed of a single kind of molecule or atomic constituent—for example, water composed only of H₂O molecules or pure manganese made up solely of manganese atoms. This is an idealized category, as real-world materials are only pure relative to detection limits."}
{"class": "Colloid", "description": "Colloid is defined as a subclass of HomogeneousMixture, characterized as a homogeneous mixture consisting of exactly one portion of 'dispersed phase' (stuff with a particular state inhering in the dispersed phase) microscopically and evenly dispersed throughout exactly one portion of 'continuous medium' (stuff with its own state inhering in the continuous phase). Colloids are distinguished from solutions by having more than one phase—while solutions have a single phase, colloids feature distinct continuous and dispersed phases. This composition is captured formally via equivalency axioms referencing specific part-whole and state relationships. Typical examples include milk, mayonnaise, agar, and fog. Colloids exhibit the Tyndall effect, making a light beam visible as it scatters off colloidal particles. Relationships between the dispersed and continuous substances are handled in the respective phase classes and are not inherent to the substances themselves."}
{"class": "Solution", "description": "Solution is formally defined as a subclass of HomogeneousMixture, characterized by a uniform composition throughout. Equivalent class axioms specify that a Solution consists of at least two “stuffs”: one acting as a Solute and one as a Solvent, each of which is inhered by some HomogeneousMixture and has a granule type restricted to Atom, Ion, or Molecule. Furthermore, a Solution must have a number of phases exactly equal to one. The class captures chemical systems where the mixing occurs at the molecular level, resulting in homogeneity; this applies to solutions in all physical states (solid, liquid, or gas). The definition intentionally omits \"dilute solution\" due to the lack of a clear-cut quantitative threshold."}
{"class": "ContinuousMedium", "description": "ContinuousMedium is defined as a subclass of StuffRole and is also known as dispersion medium. It is explicitly disjoint with DispersedPhase, ensuring that no individual can simultaneously belong to both classes. Members of ContinuousMedium are characterized by having a colloidFormingRelation to at least one DispersedPhase, reflecting their essential role in colloidal systems as the medium in which dispersed phases are distributed."}
{"class": "DispersedPhase", "description": "DispersedPhase is defined as a subclass of StuffRole. It refers to the role played by a substance within the context of a colloidal system, specifically as the phase that is distributed throughout another phase (the ContinuousMedium). The relationship (colloidFormingRelation) exists between the DispersedPhase and the ContinuousMedium themselves, rather than their respective bearers (stuffs), emphasizing that simply combining the substance bearers does not suffice to form a colloid. Proper mixing is required to achieve a homogeneous colloidal mixture; the ability of a substance to serve as either dispersed phase or continuous medium depends on the specific system being formed."}
{"class": "Solute", "description": "Solute is defined as a subclass of StuffRole and is explicitly disjoint from Solvent, ensuring that no entity can simultaneously be both a Solute and a Solvent. Formally, every Solute is related through the inverse of solutionFormingRelation to some Solvent, indicating its essential role in solution formation. Conceptually, a Solute is a substance that is dissolved in another substance (the Solvent)."}
{"class": "Solvent", "description": "Solvent is defined as a subclass of StuffRole. It represents a substance in which another substance, known as the solute, is dissolved. Solvents are essential participants in solution-forming relations, acting as the medium that enables solutes to dissolve and sometimes facilitating various chemical reactions during the dissolution process. This formalization emphasizes the role-based nature of solvents within chemical systems."}
{"class": "Distribution", "description": "Distribution is defined as a subclass of Quality and is characterized by a property restriction specifying that it must have at least one quale that is either an EvenDistribution or an UnevenDistribution. This means that any instance of Distribution necessarily possesses a quality that can be further identified as representing either an even or uneven distribution pattern."}
{"class": "Drop", "description": "Drop is defined as a subclass of Piece, representing a specific type of piece, such as a drop of blood. This class serves as an example to illustrate a distinct, often small and discrete, portion or quantity of a substance."}
{"class": "Lump", "description": "Lump is defined as a subclass of Piece, representing a specific type of piece. The class is exemplified by instances such as a \"lump of clay,\" illustrating that a lump is considered a particular form or configuration of a piece. This class serves as an example of how the concept of \"piece\" can be specialized."}
{"class": "Slice", "description": "Slice is defined as a subclass of Piece, representing a specific type of piece. As indicated in the example, a Slice could refer to a slice of bread, illustrating that this class captures instances where something is cut or divided into thin, flat portions."}
{"class": "Emulsion", "description": "Emulsion is defined as a subclass of DispersionColloid and is equivalent to a DispersionColloid with exactly one liquid in the continuous medium and exactly one liquid in the dispersed phase. The class axiom enforces that an emulsion must have two distinct parts: a liquid continuous medium and a liquid dispersed phase. Examples include milk, mayonnaise, and hand cream, where both the continuous and dispersed phases are liquids. This classification captures the key characteristic of emulsions as colloidal mixtures of two immiscible liquids."}
{"class": "Foam", "description": "Foam is defined as a subclass of DispersionColloid and is equivalent to a DispersionColloid composed of exactly one dispersed phase (gas) and exactly one continuous medium (liquid). Formally, a foam must have as part exactly one \"stuff\" that is a gas phase (dispersed) and one \"stuff\" that is a liquid phase (continuous medium). Examples include whipped cream and shaving cream. In summary, a foam is a type of colloidal system in which gas bubbles are dispersed in a continuous liquid medium."}
{"class": "Gel", "description": "Gel is a subclass of DispersionColloid and is defined as a colloidal system consisting of exactly one solid continuous medium and exactly one liquid dispersed phase. This means that in a gel, the solid component forms a continuous network throughout the material, while the liquid is dispersed within it. Examples include agar, gelatin, and jelly. The class axioms ensure that any instance of Gel must have a solid state as the continuous medium and a liquid as the dispersed phase, formalizing its structural composition as described in the referenced sources."}
{"class": "LiquidAerosol", "description": "LiquidAerosol is a subclass of DispersionColloid, formally defined as a system where the continuous medium is a gas and the dispersed phase is a liquid. It is equivalent to a DispersionColloid that contains exactly one part of a gaseous substance inhering in the continuous medium and exactly one part of a liquid substance inhering in the dispersed phase. Examples include fog, mist, and hair sprays."}
{"class": "Sol", "description": "Sol is defined as a subclass of DispersionColloid, precisely characterized as a colloidal system consisting of exactly one liquid continuous medium and exactly one solid dispersed phase. The class axiom specifies that the system contains:  \n- one part (Stuff) in a liquid state inhering in the continuous medium, and  \n- one part (Stuff) in a solid state inhering in the dispersed phase.  \nThis structure excludes the possibility of additional types of states or phases within the sol. Typical examples include pigmented ink and blood, where solid particles are dispersed uniformly within a liquid medium."}
{"class": "SolidAerosol", "description": "SolidAerosol is defined as a subclass of DispersionColloid, and is equivalent to a DispersionColloid that contains exactly one component of Stuff in the gas state, serving as the continuous medium, and exactly one component of Stuff in the solid state, serving as the dispersed phase. This class formalization describes systems where solid particles are dispersed throughout a gaseous medium. Typical examples include smoke, clouds with solid particulates, and other solid particulates suspended in gas."}
{"class": "SolidFoam", "description": "SolidFoam is a subclass of DispersionColloid, characterized by having a solid as the continuous medium and a gas as the dispersed phase. Formally, each instance of SolidFoam consists of exactly one part that is a solid (constituting the continuous medium), and exactly one part that is a gas (constituting the dispersed phase). Examples include aerogel and styrofoam. This structure ensures that SolidFoam represents colloidal systems where gas is dispersed throughout a solid matrix."}
{"class": "SolidSol", "description": "SolidSol is defined as a subclass of DispersionColloid and is equivalent to a DispersionColloid that contains exactly one portion of solid-state stuff as the continuous medium and exactly one portion of solid-state stuff as the dispersed phase. In other words, both the dispersed phase and the continuous medium are solids. SolidSol colloids are exemplified by materials like cranberry glass, where solid particles are dispersed within a solid medium."}
{"class": "EvenDistribution", "description": "EvenDistribution is defined as a subclass of AbstractRegion. This indicates that every instance of EvenDistribution is a type of abstract region, but with additional implied properties that distinguish it from other abstract regions. No further property restrictions, equivalence, or disjointness axioms are specified. The class likely represents distributions characterized by some notion of \"evenness\" or uniformity, although the specifics are not constrained by the given axiom."}
{"class": "NumberOfPhases", "description": "NumberOfPhases is defined as a subclass of AbstractRegion, where each instance must have at least one associated data value of type xsd:nonNegativeInteger (i.e., a non-negative integer). This class provides an alternative way of modeling the number of phases, as opposed to direct datatype usage. The formalization requires that every NumberOfPhases individual be characterized by a non-negative integer value indicating the number of phases."}
{"class": "UnevenDistribution", "description": "UnevenDistribution is defined as a subclass of AbstractRegion. This indicates that every instance of UnevenDistribution is a specific kind of AbstractRegion, likely representing regions or segments where distribution is not uniform. No additional constraints or properties are specified, so this class primarily serves to differentiate non-uniform or irregular distributions within the broader category of abstract regions."}
{"class": "Gas", "description": "Gas is defined as a subclass of StuffState. This classification indicates that Gas represents a particular state or condition in which a substance (stuff) can exist. Any individual classified as Gas inherits the general properties of StuffState, marking it as a type of physical state distinct from other possible states (such as solid or liquid)."}
{"class": "Liquid", "description": "liquid is defined as a subclass of StuffState, representing a specific physical state of matter. All instances of liquid must also be instances of StuffState, situating liquids within the broader classification of material states such as solid or gas. No additional property restrictions or disjointness axioms are specified for this class."}
{"class": "Solid", "description": "Solid is defined as a subclass of StuffState, representing a particular state of matter. This class encompasses all entities that exist in the solid state, distinguishing them from other possible states such as liquid or gas. All instances of Solid inherit the characteristics of StuffState."}
{"class": "HeterogeneousMixture", "description": "HeterogeneousMixture is a subclass of MixedStuff, formally disjoint from HomogeneousMixture, meaning no mixture can be both heterogeneous and homogeneous simultaneously. Members of this class are defined by having at least two different granule types (each being a Molecule or MultiMoleculeParticle) and consisting of a minimum of two distinct parts, each being either MixedStuff or PureStuff. Additionally, every HeterogeneousMixture exhibits exactly one instance of UnevenDistribution, ensuring that its components are not distributed uniformly. As described, a HeterogeneousMixture is a combination of different substances, often with visibly different particle sizes, which do not react chemically and can be separated by physical means (such as filtration). Unlike a homogeneous mixture, any portion of a heterogeneous mixture may differ in composition from the whole, unless special care is taken in selecting the portion."}
{"class": "HomogeneousMixture", "description": "HomogeneousMixture is a subclass of MixedStuff, defined by two main characteristics: (1) it contains only atoms, ions, or molecules as its granule types, and (2) it requires exactly one EvenDistribution of its constituent substances, ensuring macroscopic sameness throughout. This means that the mixed substances are uniformly distributed in all parts of the matter. Unlike some stricter definitions that limit homogeneous mixtures to solutions, this class inclusively encompasses mixtures with uniform distribution (including some colloids), with further refinement distinguished in its subclasses."}
{"class": "LeastPortion", "description": "LeastPortion is defined as a subclass of Portion that does not contain any further Portion as a part (i.e., it cannot be subdivided into smaller portions). It represents the smallest possible portion that still exhibits all macroscopic properties characteristic of its kind, analogous to the concept of an atom in mereology, but specifically applied to \"stuffs\" or material substances. This ensures that individuals of LeastPortion are indivisible relative to the kind of material or substance under consideration."}
{"class": "Piece", "description": "Piece is defined as a subclass of Portion, characterized by the axiom that it is a self-contained, scattered portion of some AmountOfStuff. According to its description, \"Piece\" represents discrete, self-contained amounts—such as slices or lumps—that are distinct from the whole but still derive from it. This class formalization ensures that any instance of Piece must be both a Portion and a self-contained segment of an AmountOfStuff, supporting modeling of individual fragments or divisions of a larger substance."}
{"class": "MicellarColloid", "description": "MicellarColloid is defined as a subclass of AssociationalColloid. Although the formal axioms do not distinguish it further from AssociationalColloid, the usage of the term \"MicellarColloid\" reflects domain-specific terminology differences between food physics and colloid chemistry. Therefore, individuals of this class share all characteristics of AssociationalColloid, with differentiation rooted primarily in contextual nomenclature rather than ontological structure."}
{"class": "Paste", "description": "Paste is defined as a subclass of Suspension. It is characterized as a type of suspension with a reduced proportion of dispersion medium, in which the dispersed phase exhibits connectivity (i.e., the particles are linked or form a continuous structure). This differentiates pastes from other suspensions, where the dispersed phase may be unconnected and more freely suspended in the medium."}
{"class": "PhysicalEndurant", "description": "PhysicalEndurant is a subclass of Endurant, representing entities that persist through time while maintaining their identity. It is explicitly disjoint with Role, meaning no instance can simultaneously be a PhysicalEndurant and a Role. Additionally, PhysicalEndurant is equivalent to om-1:Phenomenon, indicating that these two classes share the exact same set of individuals. This class is used to capture enduring phenomena in ontological modeling, distinct from roles that entities might play."}
{"class": "Role", "description": "Role is defined as a subclass of Endurant, indicating that any individual classified as a Role is also necessarily an Endurant. This positions Role as an entity that persists through time while possibly undergoing changes. No further restrictions or disjointness conditions are specified for this class."}
{"class": "Portion", "description": "Portion is defined as a subclass of AmountOfStuff, representing a specific part or segment derived from a larger whole. Every Portion is characterized by the property restriction that it must be a portion of some AmountOfStuff, ensuring a relational dependency with another instance of AmountOfStuff. This formalization encapsulates the idea that a Portion cannot exist independently, but always as a part related to a greater quantity or whole."}
{"class": "PureBulk", "description": "PureBulk is a subclass of PureStuff, defined as equivalent to those entities that consist of PureStuff whose granule type is exclusively and exactly one type of MultiMoleculeParticle. This means all granules within a PureBulk are restricted to a single specified kind of multi-molecular particle, differentiating it from StructuredPureStuff and UnstructuredPureStuff where basis types may vary. Typical examples include a silo of soy beans, a packet of tea biscuits, or a bag of cashew nuts, where each bulk contains only one type of multi-molecular particulate basis."}
{"class": "StructuredPureStuff", "description": "StructuredPureStuff is defined as a subclass of PureStuff and is disjoint with UnstructuredPureStuff, ensuring that no individual can be both StructuredPureStuff and UnstructuredPureStuff. Formally, StructuredPureStuff is equivalent to PureStuff that has granules exclusively of exactly one type of molecule. This class covers matter composed of a single molecular type (allowing for minor conformational variations or rare impurities), such as water (H₂O), table sugar, silica (SiO₂), or vitamin A. The synonym \"Compound\" applies here, reflecting the requirement that instances consist of precisely one molecular species, rather than just a single molecule."}
{"class": "UnstructuredPureStuff", "description": "UnstructuredPureStuff is a subclass of PureStuff, formally defined as material that contains exactly one type of atom as its granular component (i.e., it satisfies the restriction [hasGranuleType only Atom] and [hasGranuleType exactly 1 Atom]). This means all constituent atoms are of the same atomic type, corresponding to the ontological equivalent of a chemical element (e.g., a quantity of helium or gold). This class is synonymous with the notion of an \"Element\" and disregards the presence of undetectable impurities. The definition intends that the \"one atom\" restriction refers to a single atomic type, not a single individual atom."}
{"class": "Region", "description": "Region is defined as a subclass of Abstract, indicating that it represents an abstract concept rather than a physical entity. This classification implies that instances of Region are used to denote conceptual or non-physical areas, rather than tangible, material locations."}
{"class": "om-1:Unit_of_measure", "description": "om-1:Unit_of_measure is defined as a subclass of Abstract, indicating that it represents a conceptual or non-physical entity within the ontology. This class is intended to capture the abstract nature of measurement units used to quantify physical or abstract quantities, rather than representing tangible objects themselves."}
{"class": "SolidHeterogeneousMixture", "description": "SolidHeterogeneousMixture is defined as a subclass of HeterogeneousMixture and is equivalent to a HeterogeneousMixture that contains at least two distinct parts, each of which is a substance (Stuff) present in the solid state. It represents mixtures where the component materials remain physically separate and are not homogenized; for example, wood, which consists of compartmentalized solid components such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and various extractives (plant hormones, waxes, terpenes, etc.). This class characterizes solid-phase systems where heterogeneity is maintained at the physical or structural level."}
{"class": "Suspension", "description": "Suspension is defined as a subclass of HeterogeneousMixture, further characterized by containing granules that are either Molecules or MultiMoleculeParticles. Formally, it is equivalent to those heterogeneous mixtures that contain both a liquid (which acts as the continuous medium) and solid particles (which form the dispersed phase) as their constituent parts. Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures where larger solid particles (>1 micron) are dispersed in a liquid and tend to separate out naturally through processes such as sedimentation, creaming, flocculation, or coalescence unless stabilized or homogenized. Typical examples include tomato juice and mud."}
{"class": "State", "description": "State is defined as a subclass of Perdurant, indicating that it represents a temporally extended entity or occurrence. As a Perdurant, a State exists over a period of time, rather than as an instantaneous or static entity. No further restrictions or distinctions are specified in the current axioms."}
{"class": "StuffRole", "description": "StuffRole is a subclass of Role, defined by the axiom that it inheres in some instance of Stuff. This class represents the specific role that a 'stuff' (material substance) assumes within a mixture, indicating its functional participation or relevance in the context of that mixture."}
{"class": "StuffState", "description": "StuffState is defined as a subclass of State. It represents the general state in which a substance (or \"stuff\") exists, such as solid, liquid, or gas. While it is relevant for describing the phase of a specific material (e.g., water as ice, liquid, or vapor), the class also accommodates cases like colloids, where the states of mixed components are important. The focus of StuffState is on the state as a property of a substance in general, rather than on the particular state of an individual stuff. This provides a foundation for distinguishing and reasoning about the states of matter across different contexts, including mixtures and colloidal systems."}
{"class": "Endurant", "description": "Endurant is formally specified as a class disjoint with Perdurant, which ensures that no individual entity can be simultaneously classified as both an Endurant and a Perdurant. This distinction typically reflects the ontological separation between entities that persist wholly through time (Endurants, such as physical objects) and those that occur in or unfold over time (Perdurants, such as events or processes)."}
{"class": "scatterPortion", "description": "The property \"scatterPortion\" represents a relationship between an original whole and a portion that was once a contiguous part of that whole but has become spatially or contextually separated over time. This property is a subproperty of \"hasProperPart\" and has \"scatteredPortionOf\" as its inverse. It has no explicitly defined domain or range restrictions. Typical examples include a slice of bread cut from a loaf or wine poured into a glass from a bottle. The property is useful for modeling portions that have been separated, with potential for further specialization according to whether the portion is associated with a container or not."}
{"class": "hasState", "description": "The property \"hasState\" is an object property with no specifically defined characteristics and no inverse property. Its domain is restricted to \"PhysicalEndurant\" entities, and its range is limited to instances of \"State\". It is a sub-property of \"owl:topObjectProperty\", indicating general applicability among object properties. This property is used to relate physical endurants to their corresponding states."}
{"class": "inheresIn", "description": "The property \"inheresIn\" has no specified characteristics or super-properties. Its domain is restricted to the class \"Role,\" and its range is restricted to \"PhysicalEndurant.\" This indicates that \"inheresIn\" relates a Role to a PhysicalEndurant entity. No inverse property is defined."}
{"class": "stuffFormingRelation", "description": "The property \"stuffFormingRelation\" relates individuals that are either ContinuousMedium, DispersedPhase, Solute, or Solvent. It has no explicit property characteristics, super-properties, or inverses. This property is used to represent relationships that characterize the formation or interactions among substances within a mixture, such as surface tension effects, molecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding), or compositional ratios (e.g., the proportional amounts required to form a mixture like lemonade). Both the domain and range are restricted to the aforementioned substance types."}
{"class": "hasSelfContainedScatteredPortion", "description": "The property \"hasSelfContainedScatteredPortion\" relates to entities such as lumps, puddles, slices, or other discrete pieces. It has no explicitly defined domain or range restrictions and no defined characteristics. It is a sub-property of \"scatterPortion\" and has \"isSelfContainedScatteredPortionOf\" as its inverse property."}
{"class": "portionOf", "description": "The property \"portionOf\" relates an entity of type AmountOfStuff or Stuff to another entity of the same type, representing a portion or part of the same kind of matter (e.g., a slice of cake to the cake, a glass of wine to the bottle of wine). The domain and range are both restricted to AmountOfStuff or Stuff. It is a sub-property of \"properPartOf\" and has no specified characteristics or inverse property. This property is intended for use with mass nouns or non-countable substances."}
{"class": "properContainedIn", "description": "The property \"properContainedIn\" has no explicitly defined characteristics, domain, or range restrictions. It is a sub-property of \"properPartOf,\" indicating that any relation expressed by \"properContainedIn\" also qualifies as a proper part relation. No inverse property is specified."}
{"class": "hasPartStuff", "description": "The property \"hasPartStuff\" lacks explicit domain and range constraints, and does not possess any special property characteristics. It is specified as a subproperty of \"hasProperPart\" and is the inverse of \"stuffPartOf\". Notably, its use implies that the related entities are distinct kinds of \"stuffs\", as the current description highlights a requirement for distinction between the entities involved."}
{"class": "hasNrOfPhase", "description": "The property \"hasNrOfPhase\" links instances of the class \"Stuff\" to integer values representing a quantity. It has no defined characteristics, super-properties, or inverse properties. The property is used to specify the number of phases associated with a \"Stuff\" instance, with the value constrained to be an integer (xsd:integer)."}
{"class": "hasContainedScatteredPortion", "description": "The property \"hasContainedScatteredPortion\" is used to relate a container to scattered portions necessarily contained within it (e.g., water in a glass). It has no explicit domain or range restrictions and does not declare any specific property characteristics. It is a sub-property of \"scatterPortion\" and has \"isContainedScatteredPortionOf\" as its inverse property."}
{"class": "isContainedScatteredPortionOf", "description": "The property \"isContainedScatteredPortionOf\" relates instances of AmountOfStuff or Stuff to other instances of the same types, indicating that the subject is a portion that originated from a larger whole and currently requires a container. As a subproperty of \"scatteredPortionOf,\" it specifically captures the context where a portion, such as 'wine in a wine glass,' was part of a bulk amount, now separated and needing containment. No explicit property characteristics, inverse, or additional hierarchical relations are defined."}
{"class": "srInheresIn", "description": "The property \"srInheresIn\" has no explicitly defined characteristics. Its domain is restricted to entities of type \"StuffRole\" and its range is \"Stuff,\" indicating it relates a \"StuffRole\" to a \"Stuff.\" It is a sub-property of \"inheresIn,\" inheriting its general semantics but providing more specific usage. No inverse property is defined."}
{"class": "partOf", "description": "The property \"partOf\" is defined as a transitive property, indicating that if entity A is part of B, and B is part of C, then A is part of C. No specific domain or range restrictions are imposed. It has no super-properties or explicitly defined inverse property."}
{"class": "solutionFormingRelation", "description": "The property \"solutionFormingRelation\" relates a Solvent (domain) to a Solute (range) and is a sub-property of \"stuffFormingRelation.\" It has no additional property characteristics or specified inverse. This property is used to represent the chemical dissolution process, where one substance (the solute) is dissolved by another (the solvent)."}
{"class": "contiguousPortion", "description": "The property \"contiguousPortion\" is defined as a sub-property of \"hasProperPart\" with no explicitly specified domain or range restrictions. It has no declared characteristics. The property has an inverse, \"isContiguousPortionOf,\" indicating a bidirectional relationship. This property is intended to relate an entity to one of its proper parts that is contiguous."}
{"class": "colloidFormingRelation", "description": "The property \"colloidFormingRelation\" relates instances of ContinuousMedium to instances of DispersedPhase, representing the association found in colloids. It is a sub-property of \"stuffFormingRelation\" and has no specified characteristics or inverse property. According to its description, this property addresses phenomena unique to colloids, such as surface tension, and does not necessarily imply a chemical reaction, distinguishing it from solution-related relations."}
{"class": "properPartOf", "description": "The property \"properPartOf\" represents the usual proper parthood relation in mereology, indicating that one entity is a proper part of another. It has no explicitly defined characteristics, domain, or range. It is specified as a subproperty of \"partOf\" and does not have an inverse property."}
{"class": "instantiation", "description": "The property \"instantiation\" is an object property with domain \"AmountOfStuff\" and range \"Stuff\", indicating that it relates particular amounts of matter to their corresponding type of stuff. This property is intentionally typed for exclusive use in scenarios where first- and second-order entities coexist in the ontology's TBox. For example, it connects a specific amount, such as \"1kg of gold\", to the general stuff \"Gold.\" It has no explicitly defined characteristics, super-properties, or inverse properties."}
{"class": "hasStuffDistribution", "description": "The property \"hasStuffDistribution\" has no specified domain, range, characteristics, super-properties, or inverse properties. Based on its axioms, it is a generic property that can relate any type of entities without restriction. No additional description is currently provided."}
{"class": "scatteredStuffPartOf", "description": "The property \"scatteredStuffPartOf\" is a subproperty of \"properPartOf\" and relates instances of \"AmountOfStuff\" or \"Stuff\" to other instances within the same classes. It is intended to connect quantities or types of matter—typically those denoted by mass nouns in natural language (e.g., gold, milk, mayonnaise)—with their constituent ingredients that are of a different type (e.g., alcohol in wine, oil in mayonnaise, sugar in cake). The property does not specify domain or range characteristics beyond these classes and has no defined inverse. It also suggests a temporal dimension, where the part was once a contiguous proper part of the whole, but is now scattered or integrated."}
{"class": "scatteredPortionOf", "description": "The property \"scatteredPortionOf\" has a domain and range restricted to either AmountOfStuff or Stuff. It is defined as a subproperty of \"properPartOf\" and has no explicitly specified characteristics or inverse. This property is intended to represent a specific kind of portion relationship but is not made a subproperty of \"portionOf\" to avoid reasoning cycles and undecidability in Description Logics. The distinction between this property and related properties is primarily temporal, which is not expressible in OWL; therefore, \"scatteredPortionOf\" and \"portionOf\" are modeled as sibling properties to enable practical property chaining in reasoning."}
{"class": "hasGranuleType", "description": "The property \"hasGranuleType\" relates entities of type Stuff (domain) to PhysicalObject (range), and is a sub-property of owl:topObjectProperty. It has no specified characteristics or inverse property. This property is used to indicate the type of physical object serving as the basic unit, or \"granule,\" in the analysis of a given Stuff. The granule type reflects the level of granularity chosen for understanding the composition of the Stuff (e.g., molecules in water), and acknowledges that different analytical contexts may establish different granule types (such as atomic, molecular, or multi-molecular levels). Terms like \"has grain\" or \"has granular part\" are also used for this relation."}
{"class": "hasQuality", "description": "The property \"hasQuality\" has no explicitly defined characteristics or super-properties. Its domain includes entities classified as Endurant or Perdurant, and its range is restricted to instances of Quality. This property is used to relate an Endurant or Perdurant to a Quality. No inverse property is specified."}
{"class": "isSelfContainedScatteredPortionOf", "description": "The property \"isSelfContainedScatteredPortionOf\" relates an entity classified as \"AmountOfStuff\" or \"Stuff\" to another entity of the same types, indicating that the former is a self-standing, scattered portion of the latter (such as a lump, drop, or slice). It is a sub-property of \"scatteredPortionOf\" and does not specify any particular characteristics or inverse properties. This property is typically used to denote portions that were once part of a larger whole but now exist as distinct, stand-alone pieces."}
{"class": "hasDataValue", "description": "The property \"hasDataValue\" relates instances of the class \"Abstract\" to data values. Although its intended conceptual range is any data type, no range is currently specified due to technical limitations in expressing unrestricted datatypes. The property has no explicitly defined characteristics, super-properties, or inverse properties."}
{"class": "stuffPartOf", "description": "The property \"stuffPartOf\" relates entities classified as AmountOfStuff or Stuff to other entities of the same categories, indicating a part-whole relationship specifically among mass nouns or substances that are not typically countable. It is a subproperty of \"properPartOf,\" emphasizing that the 'part' is a distinct type of stuff or ingredient within another. No additional property characteristics or inverse are specified. Examples include alcohol as a stuff-part of wine, oil in mayonnaise, or sugar in cake."}
{"class": "hasPortion", "description": "The property \"hasPortion\" is a sub-property of \"hasProperPart\" and has \"portionOf\" as its inverse. While there are no explicit domain or range restrictions or defined characteristics, \"hasPortion\" is intended to relate an entity to a part that consists of the same substance or kind as the whole. Practically, it represents portions or divisions of a material entity at a given instant; for example, different amounts of wine divided from a whole. The property is useful in representing naive chemistry, although continuous changes at the molecular level may challenge the strict philosophical notion of 'portion.'"}
{"class": "hasPart", "description": "The property \"hasPart\" does not have explicitly defined characteristics, domain, or range restrictions in its current axiom. It is specified as the inverse of the property \"partOf\" and has no super-properties. According to the existing description, \"hasPart\" may overlap with related notions like \"hasComponent\" and \"composedOf,\" with subtleties in the essentiality or accidental nature of parts in different contexts. Domain and range constraints, where relevant, are managed in the inverse property \"partOf.\" This property is intended for modeling part-whole relationships."}
{"class": "containedIn", "description": "The property \"containedIn\" has no explicitly defined characteristics, domain, or range restrictions. It is specified as a sub-property of \"partOf,\" indicating that it expresses a specialized containment relationship within the broader context of part-whole relations. No inverse property is defined."}
{"class": "isContiguousPortionOf", "description": "The property \"isContiguousPortionOf\" relates an instance of AmountOfStuff or Stuff to another of the same types, indicating that the subject is a contiguous portion of the object. It is defined as a sub-property of \"properPartOf\" and has no specified inverse or additional property characteristics. Although originally intended as a super-property of \"portionOf\", it is classified as a sibling to avoid logical cycles and maintain decidability within OWL reasoning. This distinction primarily addresses semantic differences involving temporality not representable in OWL."}
{"class": "hasScatterStuffPart", "description": "The property \"hasScatterStuffPart\" is defined as a sub-property of \"hasProperPart\" and has \"scatteredStuffPartOf\" as its inverse property. There are no explicitly specified characteristics, domain, or range restrictions for this property. It is intended to associate an entity with a scattered or distributed part of itself, aligning it with the mereological concept of proper parts but specifically for parts that are scattered."}
{"class": "hasProperPart", "description": "The property \"hasProperPart\" has no explicitly defined characteristics, domain, or range restrictions. It is a sub-property of \"hasPart,\" indicating a hierarchical relationship. The inverse property is \"properPartOf,\" which relates an entity to its proper whole. This property is used to specify that one entity is a proper (non-identical) part of another."}
{"class": "hasQuale", "description": "The property \"hasQuale\" has no explicitly defined characteristics or super-properties. Its domain is restricted to instances of \"Quality\" and its range to instances of \"Abstract.\" This property is intended to link a quality to its associated abstract value or quale. No inverse property is specified."}
