{"class": "Berry", "description": "Berry is defined as a subclass of FruitingBody, meaning every berry is a type of fruiting body. The class Berry encompasses all fruit structures that meet this ontological classification; no further restrictions or distinguishing characteristics are specified beyond their membership in the FruitingBody category."}
{"class": "Apple", "description": "Apple is defined as a subclass of FruitingBody, indicating that every apple is a specific type of fruiting body. This classification positions apple within the broader category of organisms or structures that produce fruit, consistent with its botanical role as the edible fruit of certain plants."}
{"class": "CarnivorousPlant", "description": "CarnivorousPlant is defined as a subclass of plant whose members are characterized by possessing the ability to consume animals; specifically, each member must eat at least some animals. This distinguishes CarnivorousPlant from other plants by its unique adaptation for animal consumption."}
{"class": "Grass", "description": "Grass is defined as a subclass of plant, meaning all instances of grass are considered plants. No additional disjointness or property restrictions are specified, so grass inherits all general properties of the plant class. This class encompasses all plant entities characterized as grass."}
{"class": "Palmtree", "description": "Palmtree is defined as a subclass of plant and is explicitly disjoint with tree, ensuring that no individual can be both a palmtree and a tree. Members of this class are characterized by the property restriction that they do not possess branches (i.e., each palmtree has no part that is a branch). This formalization distinguishes palmtrees from other trees and plants in the ontology, emphasizing their unique morphological trait of being branchless."}
{"class": "tasty-plant", "description": "tasty-plant is defined as a subclass of plant whose members are characterized by being consumed by at least one herbivore and at least one carnivore. This class formalizes the notion of plants that are eaten by both trophic groups, as indicated by the axiom ([eaten-by some carnivore] and [eaten-by some herbivore]). Consequently, any instance of tasty-plant must be a plant that serves as food for both a carnivore and a herbivore."}
{"class": "tree", "description": "tree is defined as a subclass of plant, specifically within the plant kingdom. Trees are characterized as a distinct type of plant, aligning taxonomically as members of the broader plant group."}
{"class": "Elephant", "description": "Elephant is defined as a subclass of herbivore, indicating that all elephants are herbivorous animals. This formalization ensures that any individual classified as an elephant is necessarily a herbivore. If further biological or behavioral characteristics are provided, they can be incorporated to enhance the class description."}
{"class": "FruitingBody", "description": "FruitingBody is defined as a subclass of PlantParts, meaning it represents a specific type of plant part within the ontology. This class is intended to capture plant structures specialized for producing and containing reproductive structures, typically involved in fruit or spore formation."}
{"class": "Phloem", "description": "Phloem is defined as a subclass of PlantParts and is characterized by being a proper part of some Stem. This formalization specifies that every instance of Phloem must be a plant part that exists as a structural component within a stem, reflecting its biological role in the transport system of plants."}
{"class": "Root", "description": "Root is defined as a subclass of PlantParts, indicating that every root is considered a type of plant part. This classification situates roots within the broader structural components of plants."}
{"class": "Stem", "description": "Stem is defined as a subclass of PlantParts, indicating that every stem is categorized as a type of plant part. No further property restrictions or disjointness axioms are specified, so this class represents the general concept of a stem within the broader hierarchy of plant anatomical structures."}
{"class": "Twig", "description": "Twig is formally defined as a subclass of PlantParts, indicating that every twig is considered a part of a plant. This classification ensures that only plant part entities can be recognized as twigs within the ontology."}
{"class": "Xylem", "description": "Xylem is defined as a subclass of PlantParts, representing a plant component that must be a proper part of at least one Stem. This formalization ensures that any instance of Xylem is always structurally associated with stems, reflecting its biologically integral role in plant vascular systems."}
{"class": "branch", "description": "branch is defined as a subclass of PlantParts and must be part of some tree, according to the property restriction. The class is described as representing branches, which are components of trees. This formalization ensures that any individual classified as a branch is recognized as a type of plant part specifically serving as a structural component of a tree."}
{"class": "leaf", "description": "leaf is defined as a subclass of PlantParts and is characterized by the property restriction that each leaf must be part of either a twig or a branch. This formalization specifies that leaves are plant structures specifically found as components of twigs or branches, aligning with the description that leaves are parts of branches."}
{"class": "Impala", "description": "Impala is defined as a subclass of animal. It is an African antelope, as described in external resources such as Wikipedia. This classification indicates that all individuals of the class impala are animals, specifically belonging to the group of antelopes native to Africa."}
{"class": "Omnivore", "description": "Omnivore is defined as a subclass of animal, disjoint with both carnivore and herbivore, meaning no individual can be both an omnivore and either a carnivore or herbivore. An individual is classified as an omnivore if it eats some animal matter, some plant matter, and also consumes something that is part of an animal or a plant. This formalization captures the core characteristic of omnivores: they are animals that include both animal- and plant-based items in their diet, and their consumption encompasses components from both kingdoms."}
{"class": "RockDassie", "description": "RockDassie is defined as a subclass of animal. Members of this class are characterized by their diet, which mainly consists of grasses and broad-leafed plants. Further information about RockDassie can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Hyrax."}
{"class": "Warthog", "description": "Warthog is a subclass of animal, characterized by an omnivorous diet. Members of this class eat fruiting bodies (such as mushrooms), grass, roots, and other animals. This formalization reflects the warthog\u2019s dietary flexibility as described in biological sources."}
{"class": "carnivore", "description": "carnivore is defined as a subclass of animal and is disjoint with herbivore, meaning that no individual can be both a carnivore and a herbivore. It is equivalent to the class of animals whose diet consists exclusively of other animals or of parts derived from animals (i.e., they eat only animals or only things that are part of animals). This formalization captures the precise biological definition: carnivores are exactly those animals that eat only animals or animal parts."}
{"class": "giraffe", "description": "giraffe is defined as a subclass of animal, disjoint with lion\u2014meaning an individual cannot be both a giraffe and a lion. Members of this class are herbivores that eat exclusively leaves or twigs, as reflected by the restriction that giraffes only consume these plant parts. This ensures that any individual identified as a giraffe must have a diet limited to leaves and twigs."}
{"class": "herbivore", "description": "herbivore is defined as a subclass of animal, and is formally equivalent to those animals that eat only plants or only things that are part of plants. This class captures all animals whose diet consists exclusively of plants or plant parts, and explicitly excludes animals that consume any non-plant matter. This definition aligns with the description that herbivores are exactly those animals that eat only plants or parts of plants."}
{"class": "lion", "description": "lion is defined as a subclass of animal, with dietary restrictions stating that it eats only herbivores, and among its possible prey, it is known to eat impalas. This means any individual classified as a lion is exclusively a consumer of herbivores, consistent with its role as a carnivorous predator in ecological systems. The description affirms that lions are animals that restrict their diet strictly to herbivorous species."}
{"class": "PlantParts", "description": "PlantParts is defined as a subclass of owl:Thing, characterized by the property that every instance is a proper part of some plant. This means that members of this class cannot be entire plants themselves, but are constituents or sections that form part of a complete plant."}
{"class": "Parsnip", "description": "Parsnip is defined as a subclass of Root, which means every parsnip is formally classified as a type of root. This class inherits all characteristics of roots, establishing parsnip as a specific instance within the broader root category."}
{"class": "animal", "description": "animal is defined as a class that is explicitly disjoint with plant, meaning no individual can simultaneously be both an animal and a plant. This formalization ensures clear separation between instances of animals and plants within the ontology."}
{"class": "is-proper-part-of", "description": "The property \"is-proper-part-of\" is an irreflexive property, meaning no entity can be a proper part of itself. It does not have explicitly defined domain or range restrictions. This property is a subproperty of \"is-part-of,\" indicating a more specific parthood relation where the part is strictly contained within another entity. No inverse property is specified."}
{"class": "is-part-of", "description": "The property \"is-part-of\" is defined as both transitive and reflexive, meaning that if an entity is part of another, and that entity is part of a third, then the first is part of the third, and every entity is considered part of itself. There are no explicit domain or range restrictions, no super-properties, and no defined inverse property. This property is typically used to represent part-whole relationships within the ontology."}
{"class": "eats", "description": "The property \"eats\" does not have explicitly defined characteristics, domain restrictions, super-properties, or an inverse property. Its range is restricted to individuals classified as animals, plants, or entities that are part of an animal or plant, indicating its use for relating an entity to what it consumes within these biological groups."}
{"class": "eaten-by", "description": "The property \"eaten-by\" has no explicit domain, range, characteristics, or super-properties defined. It is specified as the inverse of the property \"eats,\" indicating that if entity A is eaten by entity B, then entity B eats entity A. No further semantic constraints are applied."}
{"class": "has-part", "description": "The property \"has-part\" is defined as transitive, allowing relationships to propagate along chains of connections. It has no explicitly defined domain or range restrictions, indicating it can relate any entities. \"has-part\" has \"is-part-of\" as its inverse property, but it is not specified as a sub-property of any other property. This property is typically used to express part-whole relationships between entities."}
