{"class": "time:DateTimeInterval", "description": "time:DateTimeInterval is defined as a subclass of time:ProperInterval. This means every DateTimeInterval is a specific type of ProperInterval, representing a continuous interval of time with explicitly defined start and end date-time values. The class is intended for use where temporal intervals need to be precisely bounded using date and time information."}
{"class": "time:Instant", "description": "time:Instant is a subclass of time:TemporalEntity, representing a specific point in time without duration. It is explicitly disjoint with time:ProperInterval, meaning no individual can be both a time:Instant and a time:ProperInterval. This enforces a clear ontological distinction between an instantaneous temporal entity and a temporal interval with measurable duration."}
{"class": "time:Interval", "description": "time:Interval is defined as a subclass of time:TemporalEntity, signifying that it represents a specific type of temporal entity. Instances of time:Interval describe durations or spans of time, distinct from other temporal entities such as instants, emphasizing an interval\u2019s extension across a portion of the temporal dimension."}
{"class": "time:January", "description": "time:January is defined as a subclass of time:DateTimeDescription, representing the temporal concept of January within a calendar system. Members of this class are restricted such that the time:month property must have the value \"01\" (indicating January), and the time:unitType property must have the value time:unitMonth, ensuring that it refers specifically to a month unit. This formalization guarantees that any instance of time:January corresponds uniquely to the month of January."}
{"class": "time:ProperInterval", "description": "time:ProperInterval is defined as a subclass of time:Interval. This means every instance of time:ProperInterval is also an instance of time:Interval, inheriting all its properties. Proper intervals represent temporal intervals with distinct start and end points (i.e., the start and end times are different), distinguishing them from instantaneous time points or degenerate intervals where start equals end."}
{"class": "time:Year", "description": "time:Year is defined as a subclass of time:DurationDescription. It represents a duration that is exactly one year in length, characterized strictly by the presence of exactly 1 value for the time:years property, and exactly 0 values for all other duration components (months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds). This ensures that any individual classified as time:Year denotes a precise and unambiguous period of one calendar year."}
{"class": "time:DayOfWeek", "description": "time:DayOfWeek is defined as a class equivalent to the set containing time:Monday, time:Tuesday, time:Wednesday, time:Thursday, time:Friday, time:Saturday, and time:Sunday.

{"class": "time:TemporalEntity", "description": "time:TemporalEntity is defined as a class equivalent to either time:Instant or time:Interval. This means any instance of time:TemporalEntity must be either an instant (representing a single point in time) or an interval (representing a duration between two points in time). This equivalence captures the generality of temporal entities, encompassing both points and periods within a temporal framework."}
{"class": "time:TemporalUnit", "description": "time:TemporalUnit is a class that is defined as being equivalent to the set containing time:unitMonth, time:unitMinute, time:unitDay, time:unitHour, time:unitYear, time:unitSecond, and time:unitWeek. This means that any individual that is an instance of any of these specific temporal units (such as month, minute, day, hour, year, second, or week) is also an instance of time:TemporalUnit, and vice versa. The class thus serves as a grouping for the major standard units used to measure time."}
{"class": "time:DateTimeDescription", "description": "time:DateTimeDescription represents a structured temporal entity that encapsulates the components of a date and time. Each property\u2014such as week, dayOfWeek, second, minute, day, month, timeZone, hour, year, and dayOfYear\u2014can have at most one value. The property time:unitType is mandatory and must have exactly one value for each instance. This ensures that every instance of time:DateTimeDescription uniquely specifies its temporal components with precisely constrained values."}
{"class": "time:DurationDescription", "description": "time:DurationDescription is a class characterized by property restrictions on its temporal components: each of the properties time:hours, time:minutes, time:seconds, time:days, time:weeks, time:months, and time:years may have at most one value associated with any instance of this class. This ensures that a duration description contains at most a single specified value for each temporal unit, allowing precise representation of time durations without ambiguity or redundancy across these components."}
