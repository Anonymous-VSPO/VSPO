This formalization ensures that codelink instances are specialized software tools tailored for advanced data processing workflows involving specific input types, multifaceted outputs, and a sequence of bioinformatics analyses.\nAxiom: {'subClassOf': ['software'], 'propertyRestrictions': ['[has specified data input some (XML or Text data set)]', '[has specified data output some (Text data set and Graph plot)]', '[is executed in some (background correction and data normalization and descriptive statistical calculation and differential expression analysis)]', '[is encoded in some R language]']}\nGenerated CQs:", "output": "Is it required for every codelink to be associated with at least one encoding in the R language? | Can a codelink exist without being encoded in the R language? | Are all instances of codelink necessarily linked to some resource in the R programming language?
