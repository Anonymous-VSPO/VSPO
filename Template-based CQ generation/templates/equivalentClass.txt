Template examples for equivalentClass axioms:

If the axiom involves 'some' or 'only' like A equivalentTo prop some/only B:
- Is A equivalent to the class that only has property 'prop' with B?
- Is A equivalent to the class that necessarily has property 'prop' with B?

If the axiom involves 'and' or 'or' like A equivalentTo prop B and/or C:
- Is A equivalent to the intersection or union of B and C?
- Are there elements in the intersection or union of B and C that are not A?
- Does A exclude any concept other than B and C?

Input axiom:
CheeseyPizza equivalentClass (Pizza and [hasTopping some CheeseTopping])

Example CQs (based on the input axiom):
Is every CheeseyPizza required to have at least one topping that qualifies as a CheeseTopping?
Can CheeseyPizza be fully defined as a type of Pizza that includes cheese as one of its toppings?
Is CheeseyPizza logically equivalent to the intersection of Pizza and those with a cheese topping?
