Current description: "Giraffes are herbivores, and they eat only leaves.",
"they also eat twigs"

Generated description could be:
giraffe is defined as a subclass of animal, and it is explicitly disjoint from lion - meaning no individual can simultaneously be both a lion and a giraffe. 
Members of this class are herbivores, characterized by a strict diet: they eat only leaves or twigs (no other food types are permitted as part of their diet). 
This formalization ensures that any individual classified as a giraffe must have an exclusively leaf- or twig-based diet, consistent with observed giraffe feeding behaviors.
